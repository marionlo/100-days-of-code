# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 03, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: started and finished the SASS curriculum on FreeCodeCamp: variables, nesting, use @mixin and @include, @if, @else, @for, @each, @map and @while directives, how to import partials, how to use an @extend directive.
I've also started the React course on freeCodeCamp even if I have already some basics knowledge thanks to my course with Udacity.

**Thoughts:** feeling motivated for this challenge, I really want to deepen my knowledge in front-end dev :)

### Day 2: October 04, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I want to do some projects in Javascript, to be more confortable with the language, so I've started the #Javascript30 challenge today. I've started working on the first project which is a Javascript Drumkit. When you press a key on the keyboard, it's supposed to play the sound defined by the key (snare, tom, clap...). Today, I've created the structure of the HTML, and began working on the CSS (flexbox...)

**Thoughts:** really need to finish the project tomorrow, i'll finish quickly the css, and add the javascript. Maybe I can add an option to select the instrument you want to play in order to improve the project.

### Day 3: October 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS and responsiveness on the First project of the #Javascript30 challenge. I tried to do a really simple design (trying to improve my web design skills along with my coding skills)

**Thoughts:** I did not have enough time to start the JS today so quite disappointed but it's the weekend so I'll have more time to work :)

### Day 4: October 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the First project of the #Javascript30 challenge, the Drum Kit. You can find it on my 30 days of Javascript repo. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling quite happy to work again with Javascript, going step by step. I will add a click event listener on the Drum Kit later so that it can work on mobile :)

### Day 5: October 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I wanted to understand a little bit more back-end programmation because it can be super useful for the creation of websites, so, I've started a course about PHP on Udemy. I've learnt how to write variables, constants, arrays for now...

**Thoughts:** PHP seems really fun, can't wait to finish the course in the following days :)

### Day 6: October 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot to say today, I've continued PHP and found some useful ressources, and I've also started to read Javascript up and going :)

### Day 7: October 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to read Javascript up and going

### Day 8: October 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I've played a little bit with the Grid display system, and started to work on the second project of the #Javascript30 challenge which is a Javascript and CSS Clock.

**Thoughts:** Didn't have a lot of time to code for the past two days, I hope it will be better tomorrow! 

### Day 9: October 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the second project of the #Javascript30 challenge, I did a Clock in JS and CSS. I've learnt a lot about transition and transform in CSS, and the Date object methods, such as getSeconds, getMinutes or getHours and how to apply style to the css with Javascript.

**Thoughts:** A good day of coding, always good to practice Javascript :) 

### Day 10: October 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued my course on PHP on Udemy, learnt about associative arrays (where you can give a name to the key) and multi dimensional arrays, where there is a parent array with children arrays inside of it.

**Thoughts:** I need to find other ressources on PHP to practice things that can be useful for a website, such as forms for example

### Day 11: October 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started to do a tutorial to create a brick breaker in Javascript on FreeCodeCamp. For now, I started to create the canvas and to do the game loop function

### Day 12: October 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've continued the brick breaker game in Javascript, started to add the event listener for the key input to control the paddle. Practiced a little bit PHP as well with some exercices, and learnt about the if and else statement.
