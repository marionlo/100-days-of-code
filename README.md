# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 03, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: started and finished the SASS curriculum on FreeCodeCamp: variables, nesting, use @mixin and @include, @if, @else, @for, @each, @map and @while directives, how to import partials, how to use an @extend directive.
I've also started the React course on freeCodeCamp even if I have already some basics knowledge thanks to my course with Udacity.

**Thoughts:** feeling motivated for this challenge, I really want to deepen my knowledge in front-end dev :)

### Day 2: October 04, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I want to do some projects in Javascript, to be more confortable with the language, so I've started the #Javascript30 challenge today. I've started working on the first project which is a Javascript Drumkit. When you press a key on the keyboard, it's supposed to play the sound defined by the key (snare, tom, clap...). Today, I've created the structure of the HTML, and began working on the CSS (flexbox...)

**Thoughts:** really need to finish the project tomorrow, i'll finish quickly the css, and add the javascript. Maybe I can add an option to select the instrument you want to play in order to improve the project.

### Day 3: October 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS and responsiveness on the First project of the #Javascript30 challenge. I tried to do a really simple design (trying to improve my web design skills along with my coding skills)

**Thoughts:** I did not have enough time to start the JS today so quite disappointed but it's the weekend so I'll have more time to work :)

### Day 4: October 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the First project of the #Javascript30 challenge, the Drum Kit. You can find it on my 30 days of Javascript repo. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling quite happy to work again with Javascript, going step by step. I will add a click event listener on the Drum Kit later so that it can work on mobile :)

### Day 5: October 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I wanted to understand a little bit more back-end programmation because it can be super useful for the creation of websites, so, I've started a course about PHP on Udemy. I've learnt how to write variables, constants, arrays for now...

**Thoughts:** PHP seems really fun, can't wait to finish the course in the following days :)

### Day 6: October 08, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot to say today, I've continued PHP and found some useful ressources, and I've also started to read Javascript up and going :)

### Day 7: October 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to read Javascript up and going

### Day 8: October 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I've played a little bit with the Grid display system, and started to work on the second project of the #Javascript30 challenge which is a Javascript and CSS Clock.

**Thoughts:** Didn't have a lot of time to code for the past two days, I hope it will be better tomorrow! 

### Day 9: October 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the second project of the #Javascript30 challenge, I did a Clock in JS and CSS. I've learnt a lot about transition and transform in CSS, and the Date object methods, such as getSeconds, getMinutes or getHours and how to apply style to the css with Javascript.

**Thoughts:** A good day of coding, always good to practice Javascript :) 

### Day 10: October 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued my course on PHP on Udemy, learnt about associative arrays (where you can give a name to the key) and multi dimensional arrays, where there is a parent array with children arrays inside of it.

**Thoughts:** I need to find other ressources on PHP to practice things that can be useful for a website, such as forms for example

### Day 11: October 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started to do a tutorial to create a brick breaker in Javascript on FreeCodeCamp. For now, I started to create the canvas and to do the game loop function

### Day 12: October 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've continued the brick breaker game in Javascript, started to add the event listener for the key input to control the paddle. Practiced a little bit PHP as well with some exercices, and learnt about the if and else statement.

### Day 13: October 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Nearly finished my Udemy courses about PHP. Learnt about elseif statement, comparison operators, logical operators, arithmetic operators, string operators (concatenation operators), assignment operators, while loop..

**Thoughts:** The construction of PHP is pretty similar to Javascript, the basics are quite easy to understand.

### Day 14: October 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I've tried to continue my Neighborhood map (Udacity front-end last project - Google Maps), but I'm a stuck to implement a different image for each location with the Flickr API. Tried to fetch the image according to the name of  the infowindow, but it's not working.

**Thoughts:** Might think again about the structure of my React App, or maybe refactor a part of the code to make it easier so that it works.

### Day 15: October 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I've continued again my Neighborhood map, I managed to add the image for the different location with ComponentDidUpdate, but there is an infinite loop. Maybe it's because there is a setState on the loop, I need to find a solution to make it work without the component rendering in a loop. I've also started a course on Angular 6, learnt how to add modules, how to use ngModel, and started to learn about Typescript.

**Thoughts:** React is difficuuuult!!!

### Day 16: October 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I've continued again my Neighborhood map, I managed to bypass the infinite loop of the ComponentDidUpdate and now the correct picture for each location is displayed :) One latest big feature to implement: when you click on the list of locations it should display the infowindow linked to the correct marker.

**Thoughts:** React is difficuuuult part2 ahaha!!!

### Day 17: October 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Clean a little bit my code for the Neighborhood map today and did some readings on articles about Javascript


### Day 18: October 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some FreeCodeCamp exercices on React and watch some videos on Javascript today

### Day 19: October 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sunday is ... Javascript Day (as pretty much everyday actually aha)! Solved some katas on Codewars to practice my algorithmic skills.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I'll buy Javascript books, to be able to improve my knowledge while commutting or when I can't be in front of my computer :) 

### Day 20: October 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ordered one Javascript and one Angular book today. I've did some katas and i've begin to read YDKJS: Scope and Closures.

### Day 21: October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've listened to a couple of podcasts (mostly on Javascript) and did some katas.

**Thoughts:** Maybe I'll work on creating my portfolio in the following days

### Day 22: October 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Katas katas katas katas on Codewars! Also read some articles on this Github, that I strongly recommend (33 Concepts Every #JavaScript Developer Should Know) : https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts#readme

**Thoughts:** The problem solving seems more and more easy for me, I really enjoy solving those small algo problems :) 

### Day 23: October 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I've learnt about CSS Variables. I knew that it was possible to create variables with SASS but I didn't know it was possible with "vanilla" CSS3. I did the third project of the Javascript30 challenge and create a small app to control the spacing, blur and color of the spacing of an image. That was fun!

**Thoughts:** that was a fun project! It's seems easier to create variables with Sass because the way to write it in pure CSS is quite complicated, especially when  you want to use the variable, var(--yourVar), that can be quite tricky :) 

### Day 24: October 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of time today so I did some katas :)

### Day 25: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a project with a friend (creation of a dashboard that display analytics on the use of an app). I had already work on it before, today we implemented a new feature to get the analytics for each person who are using the app. Was mostly html, css and also javascript and Jquery-UI. I learnt how to add images on a option tag (which is normally supposed to plain plain text). 

**Thoughts:** that was a lot of fun, I really like to work on concrete projects :)

### Day 26: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've done my 5 pull requests for the Hacktoberfest. I also continued to learn Angular and did my first app in (Guess the number app), nothing complicated for now, an app with only one component, and I started to read Professional JavaScript for Web Developers.

### Day 27: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started to learn a little bit more about Typescript, which allow to define the type of a variable (string, number, boolean...), classes with private properties only accessible in the class, or public properties...

### Day 28: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today was "correct the bug day". Worked again with my friend on his dashboard project, had to correct a bug that prevented a form to be submitted because of a JS+Jquery script that was converting option tags in un unordered list and removing my onchange method. Had to fix it by appending a click method to my script on the li tag to submit the form. 

**Thoughts:** Finding the solution to a problem when you code is the best feeling ever!! :) Really enjoyed solving this issue

I've learnt to create a class, learnt about pipes such as the UppercasePipe to format a string, the two-way binding with the ng-model where you bind a property to a html element so that the data can flow, and also the FormsModule and the * ngFor repeater directive.

### Day 35: November 07, 2018
**Today's Progress**:Continued the Tour of Heroes tutorial: I added a click event on the hero list with Angular's binding syntax, learnt about ngIf to conditionally include or exclude a block of HTML and splitted my components.

**Today's Progress**: Good progress today, I've added the Scrollify library, made a bouncing animation on an arrow icon of the first section to go directly to the about me section. Added Scrollify also on the other sections so that the website navigation seems smooth :)

### Day 42: November 15, 2018
**Today's Progress**: I really enjoy to create my Portfolio! Today I began working on the "About me" section of my portfolio, created the content and added some CSS on the section. Will add the skills tomorrow :)

### Day 43: November 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to create the About me section of my portfolio, I have written about the skills and the tools that I use. Tomorrow I'll add integrate it in the HTML and style the section.

### Day 57: December 03, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started to add the mosaic of projects on my portfolio with Flexbox and some style on the section. Will feature 6 or 8 projects, I think that's a convenient number.

**Thoughts:** will probably refactor tomorrow with a grid system which seems more convenient for what I need after several researchs.

### Day 58: December 04, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Refactored my mosaic of projects on my portfolio. Instead of a flexbox, I've added a grid system which seems to work much better.
